# Tweet Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs sentiment analysis on tweets. The analysis involves text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building machine learning models to classify tweet sentiment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify tweets into various sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, and neutral. Sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights into public opinion on a variety of topics and can be applied in fields like marketing, politics, and social research.
